Welcome

Welcome to the `Global Periurban Forum <https://forum.periurban.org>`_ Documentation.
Here in this online documentation, you will find information on what `Global forum Community <https://forum.periurban.org>`_ is for and what policies you should be aware of.


What is the Periurban Initiative Global Forum?
=======================================================
In this group we will share postings/requests questions, ask for advice, schedule meetups, search for details on a specific member and interact with other members across the Global Forum. All posts and replies are connected/grouped and structured so that you can have a proper conversation on a topic and not just a flow of messages. Plus, posts and comments are searchable so you can refer back to past discussions and questions!

  

What policies do I need to be aware of?
============================================
All communications in the group should be written in a way that provides more context to members who would read them. They should be inviting to read and should encourage readers to respond. 

The following minimum information should be provided in the body of your message:

#. *Current Location*
#. *Current Company*
#. *Current Role*
#. *Purpose for your request*
#. *Guidelines for posts*


Postings
---------------------------------
Job-related posts should be directed to the Jobs group. Please do not post these in your individual city groups, as they will be removed.


Meetups in Different Cities
---------------------------------
If you are traveling to a different city, and wish to connect with local members, feel free to post in the relevant city group.


Promotions of Products/Services
----------------------------------
Consistent with our previous policy, one email per quarter is allowed for a member promoting his/her product. [insert your own policy here, this is just an example]



Promotions of Events
-----------------------------------
Emails about events should be limited to events that are a clear fit with the overall vision.

Sharing Contents
------------------------------------
Articles should include something that states why the article is relevant, and members should be encouraged to include comments / questions, etc. There should be a clear reason why this article is being shared with the broader group.

The following types of content should not be sent out:
----------------------------------------------------------
Unapproved requests for donations/fundraising (especially important for maintaining 501(c)(3) status)- Emails requesting capital/funds for a venture (unless relevant)- Repeated emails for self-promotion (typically, one email per quarter is allowed for a member promoting his/her product)- Requests for protected media/material (protected through copyright/membership/etc.)- Repeated emails (i.e. one member shares an article and a number of days later the article is shared again).- Members who repeatedly violate our policies regarding posting will be removed from the Global forum platform.

If you see a post or comment you have an answer to, do chime in for the good of the community.

Create psots with a clear purpose:
